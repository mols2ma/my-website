                 working website, so my friends and I decided to work on one from scratch! We initially utilized
                 bootstrap so that our website can be mobile-friendly. We then transitioned into use Gatsby.js to
                 the process of website building faster and efficient. <br><br> I was mostly in charge of creating the design and
                 layout of the website in which I used <a href="https://www.figma.com/" target="_blank">Figma</a>. I also helped write the html
                 files for each page in which I learned Bootstrap. <br><br> The website it set to launch in mid-September.
